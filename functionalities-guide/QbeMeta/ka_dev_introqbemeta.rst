FREE INQUIRY
============

This detailed user guide is dedicated to the Qbe (acronym of Query By Example), a Free Inquiry instrument which empowers users with easy and free access to information via graphical interfaces.

Free Inquiry indicates the modus operandi of analysts and operational users that are usually seeking for business analysis that are not limited to pre-arranged lists of results. This method has a medium level of difficulty since it requires an adequate knowledge of data management and a structured organization of work.

QbE is the tool that lets you develop your free inquiry through an entirely graphical modality. Moreover, you can execute the query, check the results, export them and save the query for further use.

The material will be divided in two main sections. The first is dedicated to build queries in the Knowage Server environment, supposing that an expert user has already created a suitable business model to analize. In the second part, we will provide the user for the principal steps to build a proper business model through the Qbe designer available in Knowage Meta.
