LOCATION INTELLIGENCE
=====================

Location intelligence is based on the idea that geographical spaces are
a particular ana-

lytical dimension in the BI domain. It is based on:

-  the geographical representation of data,

-  interaction with GIS systems,

-  spatial data,

-  spatial operators.

Location Intelligence usually guarantees:

-  an immediate perception of a phenomena distribution over a
      geographical area,

-  interactivity, • multivariate analysis,

-  temporal snapshots.

Location Intelligence is becoming widely used, mostly thanks to the
emergence of location services such as Google Maps. This domain is very
easy to use for all kinds of users, usually analysts and operational
profiles. By contrast, its management is not as easy, especially if it
implies an internal management of the geographical data base.

Basic concepts
-------------------

The term Location Intelligence refers to all those processes,
technologies, applications and practices capable to join spatial data
with business data, in order to gain critical insights, to better
support decisional processes and to optimize business activities.

At the technological level, this correlation is the result of the
integration between the software systems that manage these two
heterogeneous types of data: geographic information systems (GIS), which
manage spatial data, and Business Intelligence systems (BI), which manage business data. This integration gives rise to new technological tools supporting decision-making processes, and the analysis on those business data that are directly or indirectly related to a geographic dimension.

Location Intelligence applications significantly improve the quality of users’ analysis based on a geographic dimension. Indeed, a Data Warehouse (DWH) almost always included such information. By representing the geographic distribution of one or more business measures on interactive thematic maps , users can quickly identify patterns, trends or critical areas, with an effectiveness that would be unfeasible using traditional analytical tools.
