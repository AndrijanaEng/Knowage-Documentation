REPORTING
=========

Reports represent the most popular type of business analysis. Indeed, they allow the visualization of data in a structured way and accordingly to predefined formats. The main characteristics of a report are:

-  combination of numerical data (tables, lists, cross tables), charts and images;

-  static and pixel-perfect layout;

-  multi-page and multi-format output (PDF, HTML, DOC, etc.);

-  organization of data by groups and sections;

-  universal usage (summary, detail, analytical or operational);

-  being suitable for off-line production and distribution (scheduled execution);

-  ease of use.

For these reasons reports usually have a pervasive level of usage: they are used by developers to perform both synthetic and detailed analysis, having a particularly low level of difficulty.

BIRT, acronim for Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools, is an open source technology platform used to create data visualizations and reports. In Figure 11.1 you can see an example of BIRT report.

Knowage Studio contains BIRT designer while Knowage Server contains the runtime engine. A BIRT template consists of an XML text file with the .rptdesign extension which is automatically generated by the Eclipse platform embedded into Knowage Studio. It can be manually modified by very expert users even though it is not a recommended practice. In this manual we will go into details on how to develop a BIRT report, from its implementation inside the Knowage Studio to its visualization inside the Knowage Server. All standard BIRT functionalities are available in the Studio but for a full overview of BIRT reporting tools and a detailed developer guide, the reader can also refer to the official documentation at `http: <http://www.eclipse.org/birt>`__
